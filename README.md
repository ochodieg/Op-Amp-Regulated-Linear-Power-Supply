Design, Testing, and Implementation of Precision Variable Voltage and Current Regulator  with Over-Current Protection


## Abstract
This project presents the design, implementation, and testing of an op-amp regulated, variable voltage, current-controlled linear power supply with integrated over-current protection - with the emphasis on 
design steps and theory of operation. 

Through a comprehensive approach that includes circuit design, component selection, and rigorous testing, this project showcases my technical proficiency, as well as my ability to develop innovative solutions to meet specific operational requirements. 
The successful execution of this project not only demonstrates my expertise in electronic design principles but also emphasizes my commitment to creating reliable and efficient power supply systems.


The power supply is engineered to deliver a voltage range of 5-27v capable of delivering a controlled load current at a range of 200mA to 1100mA, with basic safety features and overcurrent protection.
